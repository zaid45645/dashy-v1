# June 13: Worked on BOM and Connections
So ive always wanted to make something, which I could keep on my desk and feel proud of! and a weather dashboard or a custom dashboard using e-ink/paper looks like the most perfect thing I could make for it. So starting off, I am thinking of using Arduino Uno and a Waveshare 4.2 inch e-paper module rather than using an ESP32 and a 7.3 inch one, cus arduino uno makes the connections easier and also has a custom software which makes it way more simplier than using ESPHome. I looked at a lot of guides and tutorials and perfected the connections. It looks wonky but well see!. I made additions to the BOM also and the final price for now comes onto 100$ which is very good compared to what we are getting from hackclub(which is 150$)!. So thats what I've done so far!

# June 15: Worked on BOM and Played Around With The Code and also The Case!
So we have got our base items ready, but we also do need to include other parts like wires and interfaces and stuff in the BOM, so thats what I worked with the BOM for today, I also took a look at the code and tried understanding it so I can use it to display the things I want, I played around with the code, by making it make circles and rectangles and also to print out the text "Zaid is Awesome" on the screen. Even though I havent gotten the screen, the code still feels like it will execute as it is simple to understand and also easy to write!. I also looked at tutorials on how to use the Arduino IDE and how I should install the necessary libraries and also ports and stuff. It will be much easier to work with it if we had the screen but we dont so we have to handle it the zaid way!. Thats all for today!

Ok so I worked on the case of the whole thing, and till now it looks great, I followed the hackpad cad guide as thats the best guide Iv'e ever followed about fusion 360, as I know nothing about it. Im aiming for a whole hackpad case design and I do think this will trurn out pretty good, I am a little disappointed about the whole size but this will work and having a small size would make it even easier and it would turn out cute!.

# June 17: Worked a lot on the Case!
So we got ourselves something for the case, like it does look pretty good, but I am skeptical that it wont fit everything including the arduino as like the width of the case seems to small and if I make it even more it would just look too thick. and also the screw holes dont look so well, so I have to ask in the channel if it looks right and if it could fit the screen and the arduino. Thats all for now!

**Total time spent: 30mins**

So I worked on that ^ this morning and this evening, I made a lot of progress by adding holes and stuff necessary everywhere for the bottom case, I even experimented with the extrusion levels of the whole thing as it's supposed to fit both the arduino uno and the screen, and somehow I found the CAD models for both of them, ggs to the guy who made it for the exact thing I needed, I fitted everything in the CAD and it looks like it is almost perfect but I am skeptical about fitting the wires as between the arduino uno and the screen, it has just a little space, so we need to work with the small jumper wires available. Thats all for today!
