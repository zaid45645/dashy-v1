# June 13: Worked on BOM and Connections
So ive always wanted to make something, which I could keep on my desk and feel proud of! and a weather dashboard or a custom dashboard using e-ink/paper looks like the most perfect thing I could make for it. So starting off, I am thinking of using Arduino Uno and a Waveshare 4.2 inch e-paper module rather than using an ESP32 and a 7.3 inch one, cus arduino uno makes the connections easier and also has a custom software which makes it way more simplier than using ESPHome. I looked at a lot of guides and tutorials and perfected the connections. It looks wonky but well see!. I made additions to the BOM also and the final price for now comes onto 100$ which is very good compared to what we are getting from hackclub(which is 150$)!. So thats what I've done so far!

# June 15: Worked on BOM and Played Around With The Code!
So we have got our base items ready, but we also do need to include other parts like wires and interfaces and stuff in the BOM, so thats what I worked with the BOM for today, I also took a look at the code and tried understanding it so I can use it to display the things I want, I played around with the code, by making it make circles and rectangles and also to print out the text "Zaid is Awesome" on the screen. Even though I havent gotten the screen, the code still feels like it will execute as it is simple to understand and also easy to write!. I also looked at tutorials on how to use the Arduino IDE and how I should install the necessary libraries and also ports and stuff. It will be much easier to work with it if we had the screen but we dont so we have to handle it the zaid way!. Thats all the work for today!
