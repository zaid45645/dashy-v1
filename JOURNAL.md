Day 1, 28/5/25, 1 hour<br>
Today I worked on the whole frame of the printer and I think it looks pretty good!, and I do think we can get the whole printer to fit under the 350$ budget provided by hackclub and the frame is called a AM8 frame I think, but anyway everything looks great and I love working on this! :) <br>
