# June 13: Worked on BOM and Connections
So ive always wanted to make something, which I could keep on my desk and feel proud of! and a weather dashboard or a custom dashboard using e-ink/paper looks like the most perfect thing I could make for it. So starting off, I am thinking of using Arduino Uno and a Waveshare 4.2 inch e-paper module rather than using an ESP32 and a 7.3 inch one, cus arduino uno makes the connections easier and also has a custom software which makes it way more simplier than using ESPHome. I looked at a lot of guides and tutorials and perfected the connections. It looks wonky but well see!. I made additions to the BOM also and the final price for now comes onto 100$ which is very good compared to what we are getting from hackclub(which is 150$)!. So thats what I've done so far!
