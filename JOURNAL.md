# May 28th: Worked on the Frame! <br>
Today I worked on the whole frame of the printer and I think it looks pretty good!, and I do think we can get the whole printer to fit under the 350$ budget provided by hackclub and the frame is called a AM8 frame I think, but anyway everything looks great and I love working on this! :) <br>

# May 30th: Worked on the Y axis! <br>
Today I worked on the y axis, which contains the bed of the printer the y mounts and also the linear rods, but for some reason there is this mesh type of thing I cant figure out how I can remove it?!, but anyway, Im aiming for a sleek AM8 design and I love how it is turning out! :> <br>
